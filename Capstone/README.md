The media queries of max-width did not work either on Android phones/tablets or on iPhone. Because of the deadline I decided to make the responsive desing only for computerr screen at first.
"small screen" test machines:
Alcatel Pixi (9022x), resolution 800*1280 189ppi, Android 5.1 Chrome 51
Samsung J (SM-J500FN), resolution 720*1280 294ppi, Android 6, Chrome ??
iPhone 6, resolution 750*1334 326ppi, iOS 10.3, Safari
The design spec is not specific enough. In "Start learning" session the 6 topics could be links to subpages, but it is not shown. My project does not handle them as links (neither in <720px version).
